## Building (IfcBuilding)
A building represents a structure that provides shelter for its occupants or contents and stands in one place.
The building is also used to provide a basic element within the spatial structure hierarchy for the components of a building project (together with site, storey, and space).

## Beam (IfcBeam) 
An IfcBeam is a horizontal, or nearly horizontal, structural member that is capable of withstanding load primarily by resisting bending. It represents such a member from an architectural point of view. It is not required to be load bearing.
