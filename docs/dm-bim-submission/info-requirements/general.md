## WHAT IS THE MODEL ATTRIBUTE MATRIX?
The Model Attribute Matrix is ​​a spreadsheet that will be used to identify and track the information that a BIM model must incorporate during the project through its permitting stages, including Preliminary, Final & Inspection building permits. This Matrix is ​​based on the "Model Element Matrix" developed to be in line with the BIM E-Submission Code Checker, & all the attributes required for a successful rule assignment & code checking process of the BIM E-Submission Platform.

## WHAT IS THE PURPOSE?
The Model Attribute Matrix was created to provide the standardized information necessary to include in the BIM models, in the various stages of project development. In addition, it allows to understand what information can be incorporateds as they advance through the building permitting Process.this Matrix should allow the Public users & BIM Professionals  to easily provide the right information, in the right amount, at the right time, for the BIM Models to allow for successful review & validation of the Models on the Platform.

"Notes:
1. This document needs to be downloaded from the official Dubai BIM E-Submission platform webpage, following the creation of each new project, as it will be regularly updated by the building permit department as necessary.
2. Each category on this Matrix has a (PredefinedType) attribute & (object Type override) attribute .
               >>PredefinedType: holds the entity specific enumerations that classifies the entity
               >>ObjectTypeOverride: allows for a custom value to be added, if no applicable enumerator can be found
3. Samples of those attribute values are given on the upper right corner of the sheet. In case the used Type did not match the proposed sample Types, please refer to IFC Classes on the buildingSMART webpage https://standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC4/ADD2_TC1/HTML/
4. The (PredefinedType) should always use Capital Letter as given in samples.
5. Some attributes such as IfcDoor.IsExternal are listed under two property sets (the Ifc standard property set and custom ""Building Permit"" set). Typically the BIM modeller will set the attribute value for the the standard property set and when models are exported to IFC, the BIM authoring tool would automatically include the attribute also under ""Building Permit"" property set if the supplied 'User Defined PropertySet Definition' file with the DM BIM standard is used to export BIM models to IFC. Some standard Ifc attributes are also requested to be under ""Building Permit"" to ensure these are exported in the ifc files.
6. An IFC file can only contain a single building or building parts from the same building. Multiple separate buildings that are not related or interconnected are not allowed in a single IFC file.
7. Appendix B is published as a buildingSMART data dictionary (bsDD) here https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/dm/DMBIMInfo
"

Below is the shortlist for all categories covered within this Matrix, each linked to the related category sheet. The Equivalent IFC Class is also summarized next to the categories list for easy indication.
