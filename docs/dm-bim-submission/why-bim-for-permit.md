# Why BIM for Digital Building Permits?

## 1. The Problem with Traditional Submissions
- 2D drawings are reviewed manually  
- Information is spread across many files  
- High risk of missing or inconsistent data  
- 2D drawings are not machine readable, BIM is.

## 2. What BIM Changes
- One digital model contains geometry and information  
- Data is structured, consistent, and machine-readable  
- The same model can be reused across project permitting  
- Less interpretation, more clarity  

## 3. What "Digital Permit" Means
- Permit review supported by digital models, not only drawings  
- Rules can be checked automatically or semi-automatically  
- Faster reviews and clearer compliance decisions  
- Better traceability and transparency  

## 4. How BIM Supports Digital Permits
- Accurate building geometry (areas, dimensions)  
- Clear classification of building elements  
- Embedded properties required for code checks  
- Ability to run automated or assisted compliance checks  

## 5. Benefits for Consultants
- Clearer requirements from authorities  
- Faster approval cycles  
- Better internal quality control  

## 6. Benefits for Authorities
- Reduced manual checking effort  
- More consistent and objective decisions  
- Better data for reporting and analytics  
- Foundation for future digital services  

## 7. Key Message
> **BIM is not about 3D models.  
> It is about structured, reliable data that enables digital permitting.**
